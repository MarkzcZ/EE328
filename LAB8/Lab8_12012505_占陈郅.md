​	The focus is on calculating the short-term zero crossing rate of speech signals and smoothing them.

Code:

```matlab
% read in speech file
[x, Fs] = audioread('test_16k.wav');

% compute short-time zero-crossing rate
frame_length = round(0.01*Fs); % 10 msec frame length
frame_shift = round(0.005*Fs); % 5 msec frame shift
zcr = zeros(1, length(x));
for i = 1:frame_shift:length(x)-frame_length
    frame = x(i:i+frame_length-1);
    zcr(i:i+frame_shift-1) = sum(abs(diff(frame>0))) / frame_length * Fs / frame_shift;
end

% plot short-time zero-crossing rate
t = (0:length(zcr)-1) / Fs;
figure;
subplot(2,2,1);
plot(t, zcr);
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Zero-crossing rate(per 10 ms)');

% design lowpass filter to preserve low frequency band
F = Fs/2;
f1 = 0.1*F; % preserve up to 1.6 kHz
f2 = 0.2*F; % remove from 3.2 kHz to 8 kHz
L = 41; % filter length
h1 = fir1(L-1, f1/F);
h2 = fir1(L-1, [f2/F, 0.5], 'STOP');
h = conv(h1, h2);

% apply lowpass filter to smooth zero-crossing rate contour
zcr_smooth = filter(h, 1, zcr);

% plot smoothed zero-crossing rate contour
subplot(2,2,2);
plot(t, zcr_smooth);
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Smoothed(per 10 ms)');

% median-smooth original zero-crossing rate contour
zcr_median = medfilt1(zcr, 7);
zcr_median = medfilt1(zcr_median, 5);

% plot median-smoothed zero-crossing rate contour
subplot(2,2,3);
plot(t, zcr_median);
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Median-smoothed(per 10 ms)');

% apply combination smoother to zero-crossing rate contour
zcr_comb = filter(ones(1,5)/5, 1, zcr_smooth);
zcr_comb = medfilt1(zcr_comb, 5);

% plot combination-smoothed zero-crossing rate contour
subplot(2,2,4);
plot(t, zcr_comb);
xlabel('Time (s)');
ylabel('Combination-smoothed(per 10 ms)');
```

​	Three different smoothing methods are used here: median smoothing, low-pass filtering smoothing, and combination smoothing. Among them, low-pass filtering smoothing is achieved by designing a low-pass filter to preserve the low-frequency band and remove interference from the high-frequency band; Median smoothing is the process of removing noise by performing median filtering on the original zero crossing rate curve; Combination smoothing is a combination of low-pass filtering smoothing and median smoothing methods. These smoothing methods can be used for feature extraction and analysis of speech signals.

​	From the results, the three smoothed images are almost identical. However, theoretically, the results of low-pass filter smoothing and combination smoothing are similar in shape, while median smoothing is relatively rough. The reason for the same situation may be that the parameters in median smoothing are relatively conservative.



#### Problem 2

> Program an autocorrelation-based pitch detector using the modified autocorrelation function in MATLAB. Compare the results using both the original speech file and those obtained from a bandpass filtered version of the speech file. The steps to follow for implementing the pitch detector are the following:
>
> 1. specify whether the talker is a male or female (the program uses the talker gender to set ranges for the pitch period contour);
>
> 2. read in the speech file (including determining the speech sampling rate, fs);
>
> 3. convert the sampling rate to a standard value of fsout=10000 Hz for this exercise;
>
> 4. design and implement a bandpass filter to eliminate DC offset, 60 Hz hum, and high frequency (above 1000 Hz) signal, using the design parameters:
>
>    stopband from 0 to 80 Hz
>    transition band from 80 to 150 Hz
>    passband from 150to 900 Hz
>    transition band from 900 to 970 Hz
>    stopband from 970 to 5000 Hz
>    filter length of n=3 01 samples
>
> 5. save both the full band speech and the bandpass filtered speech files for processing and comparison;
> 6. play both the original and bandpass filtered speech files to be sure that the filtering worked properly;
> 7. block the signal into frames of length L=400 samples (corresponding to 40 msec in duration), with frame shift of R=100 samples (corresponding to 10 msec shift duration);
> 8. compute the frame-by-frame modified correlation between the frames of signal specified as:
>   s1[n] = [s[n],s[n + 1],...,s[n + L-1]],
>   s2[n]=[s[n],s[n +1],...,sn +L+pdhigh -1],
>   where n is the starting sample of the current frame, and pdhigh is the longest anticipated pitch period (based on the gender of the speaker) and is specified as:
>   pdhigh=fsout/150 for females and fsout/75for males
>   (Hint: Use the MATLAB function xcorr to compute the modified correlation between s1[n] and s2[n] as it is considerably faster than any other implementation)
> 9. search from pdlow to pdhigh to find the maximum of the modifed autocorrelationfunction (the putative pitch period estimate for the current frame), along with thevalue of the modified autocorrelation at the maximum (the confidence score), usingthe range estimate of
>   fsout/200 for malespdlow=fsout/300 for females.
>   do all operations on both the original file and the bandpass filtered speech file;
> 10. convert the confidence score (the value of the modified autocorrelation at the10maximum) to a log confidence, set a threshold at 0.75 of the maximum value of the log confidence score, and set the pitch period to zero for all frames whose log confidence scores fell below the threshold;
> 11. plot the resulting pitch period contour along with the log confidence scores for boththe original speech file and the bandpass filtered speech file: how do these contourscompare?
> 12. use a 5-point median smoother to smooth the pitch period scores as well as theconfidence scores;
> 13. plot the median smoothed pitch period scores along with the median smoothed confidence scores;
> 14. save the computed pitch period and confidence scores in the file out_autoc.mat.
>    Which processing works best; i.e, using the full band original speech file or using the bandpass filtered speech file? How much difference do you observe in the resulting pitch period contours?

To determine which processing works best, we can compare the resulting pitch period contours for the original speech file and the bandpass filtered speech file. We can observe the difference in the resulting pitch period contours by comparing the two plots.

Code:

```matlab

% Set gender to 'male' or 'female'
% 2. Read in the speech file (including determining the speech sampling rate, fs)
% 3. Convert the sampling rate to a standard value of fsout=10000 Hz for this exercise

% 4. Design and implement a bandpass filter to eliminate DC offset, 60 Hz hum, and high frequency (above 1000 Hz) signal, using the design parameters:

a = [0 0 1 1 0 0];
b = firpm(n-1, f, a);
s_filtered = filter(b, 1, S);

% 5. Save both the full band speech and the bandpass filtered speech files for processing and comparison
audiowrite('speech_file_full.wav', S, fsout);
audiowrite('speech_file_filtered.wav', s_filtered, fsout);

% 6. Play both the original and bandpass filtered speech files to be sure that the filtering worked properly

%    (Hint: Use the MATLAB function xcorr to compute the modified correlation between s1[n] and s2[n] as it is considerably faster than any other implementation)

- Analysis

The given code is a pitch detector that takes in an audio signal and returns the pitch, pitch period, peaks, median smoothed pitch period, and median confidence. The code uses the cepstrum method to detect the pitch of the audio signal. The cepstrum is the inverse Fourier transform of the logarithm of the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the windowed signal.

The code first applies a Hamming window to the audio signal and then calculates the cepstrum of the windowed signal. The cepstrum is then searched for the pitch period by finding the maximum value within a range of lag values that correspond to the minimum and maximum pitch values based on the gender of the speaker. The pitch period is then used to calculate the pitch frequency.

The code then finds all peaks in the cepstrum and removes duplicate peak values. The peak values are then converted to lag values and then to pitch periods and times. The median smoothed pitch period and confidence are then calculated using a 5-point median filter.

Finally, the code plots the speech signal with the detected pitch and resonance peaks, as well as the median smoothed pitch period and confidence.

Overall, this code provides a useful tool for analyzing the pitch of an audio signal and could be used in a variety of applications such as speech recognition and music analysis.
